# UX: #

## **Strategy:** ## 

**Is the content culturally appropriate?** 

- Culturally speaking in the uk the italian food, and more the pizza have a big impact in the marrket, owrth 2.1billon pounds is the prove of a big love for this product. 

**Is the content relevant?** 

- The website its aimed for the pizza lovers, who want to not just make or take recipies from the cooking book, also they can share their own recipies to the pizza lovers comunity, and the access to a wide group of coocking tools to make it more easy 

**Can we track a catalogue the content in an intuitive way?**

- This website will be divide in sections to make it more intuitive and easy for the user, the main sections will be The coocking book itself, My recipies, a about us.

**Is the technology appropiate?** 

- Will be using html5, css and Js for all the user interface, and python,SQL for all the backend, the user interface will be full responsive to adapt to any device, but will be aimed for mobile devices 

**Comprany Goals.** 

- Because its a coocking ampliance company they love this art, the main goal is reach all the pizza comunity lovers and show them all the coocking tools avaible for the recipies, with this function make possible sell the product or make the brand known in the comunity 

**Users goals.** 

- The user goal is  find a new way to cook a pizza, share recipies, and enjoy new ones, share opinions about the differents recipies, and if its needed have the possibility to find the tool to make it perfect 
 
**What are the pros of what they're doing, and what are the cons?** 
- The pros of macking a coocking social media book, its the avility to make our brand more known, so its not just the people from the comunity searchins a recipie or sharing it, its about make our brand notice in every single recipie.
- The cons can be the posibility of the user to be more concentrate in the recipies than in the product itself, we can fix this with a good presens of the product in the recipie section.
	 
**What are they missing?** 
- They have videos, times, ingredients, and an explanation about every single step, but in any place they wrote wich tool you need to cook it, so in our website will be including this, and let the consumer know before they start what are the ingredient, tools and time necesary to make the recipie.
	 
**What are they doing, but they could be doing better?** 
- They can inprove the accesibility of the website, the competitor have videos made with background music without any instruction of what its happening in the video, wich is really limiting the audience of this video for the peaple who can see, they can add not just a video with music, we can add instructions, and a more detailed recipie for each of the steps.

## **Scope**

*	Taking the strategy now in the scope we can think in the main feactures of this website, making a good pizza cooking book, but at the same time make the brand be known by adds:

* **The main feactures**: the possibility of navigating between the following options to find quick as possible the information needed:
    * A home page, with information about our love for the pizza and show the pasion about it.
    * A recipe section with all the recipes by categories for quick access.
    * A data base of users, and recipes.
    * Adds about our products, but avoiding invasive adds.
    * An admin panel to upload product to a data base and administrate users,recipes and adds.

* **Full mobile device compatibility**: The inclusion of being able to navigate the site from any device, including access from a mobile.

* **Desired functions for the future**: 
    * Conection to a social media.
    * Conection to a whatsapp service for contact and the posibility to sell products
    * Implement multi-language options
    * Users can upload videos about their recipes.
    * The posibility to make a review about a recipe.

## **Structure**

In this section the basic structure will be outlined, and how the information will be presented.

*	**What a guest would like to see the first time:**
    * Recipes about pizzas
    * A quick way to see all recipes
    * A navbar with access to a profile (control panel) to an easy way to share recipies
    * A contact details, social media (if is a possible customer lookingfor cocking tools)


*	**How I present this information: The best way for me to present the info is to make the web site minimalistic.**
