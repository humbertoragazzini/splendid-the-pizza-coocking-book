Why we are so especial? 

		 
Do stakeholder interviews first. 

		 
Interview people who are involved in making decisions to create the product in the 	first place. 

 
Find out what they want and what will give them value for having that product out in 	the wild. 

 
Do a competitor review. 

 
Who else is doing this? 

	 
What are the pros of what they're doing, and what are the cons? 

	 
What are they missing? 

	 
What are they doing, but they could be doing better? 

	 
Equally important, do user interviews and research. 

	 
Ask people, would you use this? 

	 
Ask them why. 

	 
And also, what a user thinks they need isn't always exactly what they need. 

	 
We get to that later on. 

	 
If you have an existing product out there, do an audit. Do a retrospective. 

	 
Find out what people like about your product. 

	 
Find out what they don't like about your product and why. 
	 

And figure out what changes you can make.
