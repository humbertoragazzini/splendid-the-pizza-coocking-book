## **Strategy:** ## 

**Is the content culturally appropriate?** 

- Culturally speaking in the uk the italian food, and more the pizza have a big impact in the marrket, owrth 2.1billon pounds is the prove of a big love for this product. 

**Is the content relevant?** 

- The website its aimed for the pizza lovers, who want to not just make or take recipies from the cooking book, also they can share their own recipies to the pizza lovers comunity, and the access to a wide group of coocking tools to make it more easy 

**Can we track a catalogue the content in an intuitive way?**

- This website will be divide in sections to make it more intuitive and easy for the user, the main sections will be The coocking book itself, My recipies, a contact form and a about us 

**Is the technology appropiate?** 

- Will be using html5, css and Js for all the user interface, and python,SQL for all the backend, the user interface will be full responsive to adapt to any device, but will be aimed for mobile devices 

**Comprany Goals.**

**Users goals.**

**Why we are so especial?**

**Find out what they want and what will give them value for having that product out in 	the wild.** 

 
**Do a competitor review.**
    https://www.delish.com/
- We search a competitor a start to check the website, its a really nice website, have almost everything we need from a coocking book, but have a big problem, in any recipie the coocking book said what kind of tools we need before cook que recipie, so we can start a recipie and in the middle of owr cook have a missing tool to finish it.
 
**Who else is doing this?** 

	 
**What are the pros of what they're doing, and what are the cons?** 
- The pros of macking a coocking social media book, its the avility to make our brand more known, so its not just the people from the comunity searchins a recipie or sharing it, its about make our brand notice in every single recipie.
- The cons can be the posibility of the user to be more concentrate in the recipies than in the product itself, we can fix this with a good presens of the product in the recipie section.
	 
**What are they missing?** 
- They have videos, times, ingredients, and an explanation about every single step, but in any place they wrote wich tool you need to cook it, so in our website will be including this, and let the consumer know before they start what are the ingredient, tools and time necesary to make the recipie.
- they are missing the peaple with disabilities, for this reaseon all the recipies are really short without much more explanation, and withpout a grade of dificulty
	 
**What are they doing, but they could be doing better?** 
- They can inprove the accesibility of the website, the competitor have videos made with background music without any instruction of what its happening in the video, wich is really limiting the audience of this video for the peaple who can see, they can add not just a video with music, we can add instructions, and a more detailed recipie for each of the steps
